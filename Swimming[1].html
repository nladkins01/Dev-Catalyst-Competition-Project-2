  <p>Swimming emerged as a competitive sport in the early 1800s in England. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in artificial swimming pools built around London, England.</p>
  <p>The fist Olympic games were held in 1896 in Athens, Greece and was a male-only competition. Six events were played for the swimming competition, but only four were actually contested: 100m, 500m, and 1200m freestyle and 100m for sailors.</p>
  <p>The second Olympic games, held in Paris, France in 1900, featured 200m, 1000m, 4000m freestyle, 200m backstroke, and a 200m team race. There were two additional unusual swimming events, an obstacle course and an underwater swimming race. The 4000m freestyle was completed in only one hour.<p/>
